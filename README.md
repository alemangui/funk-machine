#Funk machine
A working version of this project can be found [here](https://alemangui.github.io/funk-machine/).

Funk machine is a way to control audio parameters and effects with gestures (when a Leap Motion controller is available) or simply by moving some sliders.

## Audio effects
Play around with the sliders to edit the effects in the ongoing track. 

## Using a Leap Motion controller

If you have a Leap Motion device, connect it to control the effects with gestures. To select which elements to control, tick the checkbox under the desired sliders. More than one slider can be controlled at the same time.

Simply move one hand up and down to control the checked sliders.

## External resources 
This demo uses [Pizzicato.JS](https://github.com/alemangui/pizzicato) and [Leap.JS](http://github.com/leapmotion/leapjs/).

Dolby Digital Plus audio format will be loaded where available.
